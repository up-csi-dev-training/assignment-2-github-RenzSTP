Stay With Me by Caitlin Myers

To you
Yes my love, to you
Yes my love, to you
You, to you

“I’m who I am, as I am; you’re who you are, as who you are”
The final words you whispered, before you left me with a scar

On your familiar silver jacket 
Splattered coffee’s left a stain, destined always to remain
And still we’re lost inside the habit
Tears reflecting in the pane, show our pitiful refrain

STAY WITH ME...
In the dead of night I’m banging on your door
I’m begging you, without you I’m done for
Now the winter arrived, like the tears in our eyes,
STAY WITH ME…
While your voice remains an echo of the past
I'm holding on to moments that won’t last
I will never forget, I will never regret our love

“Confusing love and lovin’, there is a difference though bizarre”
The final words you whispered, before you left me with a scar

Another winter is arriving
Like a bird you went away, migrate back to me and stay
But still I’m lost inside the habit
Here I’m yearning for your touch, will it ever matter much

STAY WITH ME...
In the dead of night I’m banging on your door
This heart of mine is breaking once more
Now the winter arrived, like the tears in my eyes,
STAY WITH ME...
For your company my pride I gave away
The needle on my record as it plays
Bittersweet melodies, on an endless repeat, it seems

STAY WITH ME...
In the dead of night I’m banging on your door
I’m begging you, without you I’m done for
Now the winter arrived, like the tears in our eyes,
STAY WITH ME...
While your voice remains an echo of the past
I'm holding on to moments that won’t last
I will never forget, I will never regret- 

STAY WITH ME...
In the dead of night I’m banging on your door
I’m begging you, without you I’m done for 
Now the winter arrived, like the tears in our eyes,
STAY WITH ME...
While your voice remains an echo of the past
I'm holding on to moments that won’t last
I will never forget, I will never regret-

STAY WITH ME...
In the dead of night I’m banging on your door
I’m begging you, without you I’m done for
Now the winter arrived, like the tears in our eyes,

STAY WITH ME...
